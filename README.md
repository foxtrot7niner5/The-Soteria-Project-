# The-Soteria-Project- 

The Soteria Project is being created in an attempt
to fight human trafficking. The plan is for users to 
be able to enter tag numbers of suspicious vehicles 
along with the location of where it was, description, 
etc etc along with people that they see following 
others around stores or if they feel theyâ€™re being 
followed, and have an SOS button that when hit sends 
their location upon activation to all users as well 
as all law enforcement in that city and the 
surrounding cities.
